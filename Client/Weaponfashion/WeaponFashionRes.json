It is surprising that it can really be used as a weapon after Wanshi's thorough modification. Equipped with Wanshi's customized energy can filled with mint-flavored gas, it can refresh the minds of its user and the target hit when it fires. It also retains a function that a toy should have. By reducing its power output, its user can blow away sleepiness with pleasantly cool winds.",
