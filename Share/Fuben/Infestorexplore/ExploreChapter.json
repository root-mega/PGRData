        "Description": "Even at this depth, the heavy concentration of Punishing Virus was impossible to endure. Without a Transcendent, you would have no way of knowing where this region began... Down below, the automated structures were under a constant barrage of corruption, causing them to build incessantly with no regard.",

In the so-called 'safety fault' found ahead, the Punishing Virus concentration had reduced to a level where Constructs could fight. In order to establish a front operation base, more personnel were stationed there. The remains and victims of previous explorations were finally found and properly recovered.",

        "Description": "However, the frontline was once again turned into a Dead Zone. This time, the exploration team obtained peculiar information with the help of visual data sent by Transcendents. But for some unknown reason, the Autopoiesis Maze seemed to be extending underground. You even found traces of shield-like structures in the surrounding rock.",
