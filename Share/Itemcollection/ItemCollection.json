        "WorldDesc": "The newest iteration of the commandant life support machine, \"L-33\", updated with voice data personally recorded by Lee. Amidst Gray Raven's relentless combat missions, this unassuming little robot undergoes continuous technical enhancements, with each update regarded as a testament to its \"growth.\" Primarily, it mirrors the seriousness and reliability of its creator, but occasionally, harmless bugs emerge, resulting in moments where it may circle around you, silently gazing up. In those instances, it seems to imply that visiting the maker directly for a fix would be the optimal solution.",

On the note that came with it is a gracefully handwritten poem: At the ferry of peach leaves, we part with a shared hairpin's grace. Haze veils the weeping willows, as we bid farewell, hearts embrace. Climbing the stairs, trepidation takes hold of me, witnessing the tempest's might, petals set free. None to hush the orioles' mournful serenade, their song endures as sorrows cascade.",
